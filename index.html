                <p>I wasn't a monster. I was just a young man who wanted to feel like I mattered. I grew up in a world where I was told that my identity was under attack, that my religion was in danger, and that I was the only thing standing between our culture and total extinction. For someone like me, who felt small and ignored, this was the ultimate drug. It gave me a purpose. It gave me a uniform.</p>
                <p>I remember the first time I put on that saffron scarf. I walked differently. I talked louder. I wasn't just Arjun from the neighborhood anymore; I was a protector. I spent my days at the local gym, lifting weights and listening to men tell me that we were the greatest people to ever walk the earth. We believed our ancestors were gods and scientists, and that everyone else was an enemy or an infiltrator. It felt good to hate. It made me feel strong.</p>

                <p>I spent my nights in digital groups, sharing videos that "proved" how we were being cheated. I didn't care about the truth; I cared about the rush. I loved the loud chants, the smell of burning incense at rallies, and the feeling of being part of a massive, angry crowd. In that crowd, I was never alone. I was important. I was a warrior. I didn't realize that I was just a foot soldier for people who didn't even know my name.</p>

                <p>The only person who didn't buy into my new personality was my sister, Meera. She was my favorite person. She was quiet, brilliant, and loved her biology books more than anything. While I was out on the streets shouting slogans, she was at home, trying to understand how the human body works. She would look at my saffron bandana and my angry face with a kind of pity that made me furious.</p>
                <p class="text-white text-3xl md:text-5xl font-light italic leading-tight">"Bhaiya, if God is so powerful, why does He need you to throw stones at people to protect Him? Is He really that weak?"</p>
                <p class="max-w-xl ml-auto text-zinc-500">I used to yell at her. I told her she was brainwashed by her college and that she didn't understand "our culture." But her questions stayed with me like a splinter under the skin. She once told me that God probably cared more about being a good neighbor than what movie was playing in the theaters. I ignored her then. I thought she was just being a "modern girl." I didn't realize that she was the only one in our house who was actually seeing the world as it was.</p>

            <div class="body-font text-zinc-400 text-lg space-y-10">
                <p>Then Meera got sick. It started with a fever that wouldn't go away. When the doctors said "Leukemia," I didn't listen to the medicine; I listened to my ego. I thought that because I was a "true devotee," God owed me a favor. I turned my grief into a religious performance. I fasted until I couldn't stand up. I went to every temple, crying and begging for a miracle.</p>
                <p>I met a Baba who told me exactly what I wanted to hear. He said that medicine was a Western poison and that a "Maha-Yagya" would cure her. I gave him everything. I spent my mother's life savings and my sister's education fund on his rituals. He told me that if I doubted him, the miracle would fail. So I forced myself to believe. I sat in front of the fire for hours, chanting words I didn't understand, while my sister lay in a hospital bed withering away.</p>
                <p class="text-white font-bold py-12 text-3xl md:text-4xl italic border-y border-white/5 my-12 text-center">"I chose magic over medicine because magic promised me control. I was wrong."</p>
                <p>I actually told the doctors to slow down the chemo because I was waiting for the "vibration" of the prayers to work. I stood over Meera and told her to have faith, while she was vomiting and losing her hair. I was so busy trying to prove that my religion was "scientific" that I forgot to be a human being to my dying sister. I was waiting for a miracle, and I didn't realize I was killing her.</p>

                <p>Meera died holding my hand. I waited for her to wake up. I waited for the Baba's promise to come true. I waited for the "vibrations" to bring her back to life. But the room stayed dead quiet. There was no light from the sky, no voice from the heavens, nothing. There was just the long, flat beep of the heart monitor.</p>
                <p>In that moment, I realized that the universe doesn't have a plan. It doesn't care about our rituals. It doesn't listen to our chants. The monitor didn't care about my faith. It just told the truth: she was gone. I sat there for hours, looking at her yellow skin and her thin hands, and I realized that I had wasted our last days together on a lie.</p>

                <p>I went back to the Baba. I wanted an explanation. I wanted my money back so I could pay for my sister's funeral. He didn't even look at me. He just said, "Your faith was weak. You didn't believe enough. Or maybe she had bad Karma from a past life." That's when I snapped. I saw the trick. He had an answer for everything, but a solution for nothing. "God's will" was just his way of getting away with a scam.</p>
                <p>I looked at the posters of warrior-gods on his walls and I saw them for what they were: just <span class="text-white font-bold">paper and stone.</span> They didn't save Meera. They didn't save my mother's savings. They were just objects used to keep people like me angry and obedient. I realized that my religion wasn't a fortress; it was a cage. I had been a "protector" of a lie that had stolen the only thing I ever loved.</p>

They thought I was just sad. But I wasn't just sad; I was finally waking up. I started reading the books Meera loved. I read about how the human body actually works, how the Earth was formed, and how the stars are just massive balls of gas billions of miles away.</p>

I just needed to open my eyes and be honest about what I saw.</p>
